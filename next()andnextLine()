What is the difference between Scanner.next() and Scanner.nextLine() ?

Let us assume user enters "Hello World" in the output console. So,

if you use Scanner.next(), you will get just "Hello" as input. The next word " World" will be ignored.
if you use Scanner.nextLine(), you will get the whole line of "Hello World".
So, it is preferred to use Scanner.nextLine() when reading String inputs from the console.
